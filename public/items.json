    "description": "Ancient Treasures Customer\n\nVikings used necklaces with animals or beasts biting onto a ring where pendants were hung. This variant consists of a King Chain ending in the heads of Geri and Freki, the wolves of Odin, that bite onto a ring with a large Mj√∂lnir pendant.\n\nThis Chain is 100% handmade from Stainless Steel, which results in a piece of fantastic jewelry that will never rust. The process of crafting it by hand is very time-consuming, since each small link is added one by one to the chain. The chain comes with a lobster clasp that keeps this massive piece secured around your neck, as well as a pendant ring that can be opened and closed easily.\n\n100% Heavy Stainless Steel\nHandcrafted, forged link by link & bound by a lobster clasp\nChoose between Chain Length of 20/24/28 Inches (50/60/70 cm)",
